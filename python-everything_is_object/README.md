# 🐍 Python - Everything is object

This project explores Python's object model and investigates how Python handles different types of objects behind the scenes. The goal is to understand Python's object-oriented programming concepts like reference counting, object identity vs equality, mutability vs immutability, and variable aliasing.

## 🔍 Background Context

This project is less about coding and more about understanding Python's object model. Most of the answers are just one word or a few characters in a .txt file. Understanding these concepts is essential for writing efficient Python code and avoiding common bugs related to object references.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

* 🧠 Understand what an object is in Python
* 🔄 Differentiate between a class and an object or instance
* 🔒 Understand the difference between immutable and mutable objects
* 🔗 Understand what reference, assignment, and aliasing mean
* ⚖️ Identify identical vs equal variables
* 📦 Understand how Python passes variables to functions

## 📋 Requirements

### Python Scripts
* 💻 All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5
* 📝 All files should end with a new line
* 🔖 First line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
* 🧹 Code should use pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
* 🔑 All files must be executable

### .txt Answer Files
* 1️⃣ Only one line
* 🚫 No shebang
* 📄 All files should end with a new line

## 📚 Tasks

The project contains 29 tasks (0-28) exploring different aspects of Python's object model:

* 🏷️ Tasks 0-5: Object types and memory addresses
* 🔍 Tasks 6-13: Testing equality vs identity for strings and lists
* 📋 Tasks 14-18: Understanding list behavior with different operations
* 📝 Task 19: Implementing a function to copy a list
* 📦 Tasks 20-26: Understanding tuple behavior and syntax
* 🔄 Tasks 27-28: List assignment vs in-place modification
